Our comprehensive approach involved experimenting with different machine learning algorithms to identify the most suitable ones for this particular case.")

st.markdown("- URL-Based Features: We extracted insightful features from the URL itself to capture potential indicators of phishing behavior.")
st.markdown("- Domain-Based Features: By analyzing the domain properties, we uncovered valuable attributes that help distinguish between genuine and malicious domains.")
st.markdown("- Page-Based Features: We delved into the contents of web pages associated with each domain, uncovering unique features that shed light on their legitimacy.")

st.markdown("### *Results*")
st.markdown("Our solution provides a robust and reliable method for predicting whether a domain is authentic or fake. By utilizing the power of machine learning, we have created a model that can effectively discern the telltale signs of phishing attempts, enabling users to make informed decisions and avoid potential security breaches.")
